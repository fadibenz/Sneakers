# Sneakers: E-Commerce Web App

This is a React application that I built while learning React for an e-commerce website of a sneakers company.

# Features

This application is a full-fledged e-commerce website with the following features:

- Navigation menu with links to different sections of the website.
- Landing page with a hero section and featured products.
- Product listing page with filters and sorting options.
- Product details page with product description, images, and related products.
- Shopping cart with the ability to add/remove items and update quantities.
- Checkout process (form validation and payment integration not included).

# Technology Stack

- React.js.
- React Router and React icons.
- Vanilla CSS.

# Design

The design of the website is inspired by a Frontend mentor challenge and various e-commerce websites and is customized to match the branding of the sneakers company. The color scheme and typography are carefully chosen to create a modern and premium look and feel. The website is fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes.
